Design Application Tips

Typography: Use white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E5E7EB) text on the navy blue (#1C2526) background for readability. For gold (#D4AF37) backgrounds, use navy blue or white text to maintain contrast.
Buttons and CTAs: Use the vibrant cyan (#00A3E0) for buttons like “Get a Quote” or “Upload Your Design,” with white or navy text inside. Add a hover effect by switching to a slightly darker shade of cyan (e.g., #008BBF).

Icons and Accents: Use the rich gold (#D4AF37) for icons, borders, or decorative elements to add a premium touch.
Consistency Across Mediums: The CMYK values provided ensure these colors can be accurately reproduced in print for branding materials like business cards or brochures. For web use, the HEX and RGB values will ensure consistency on screens.
